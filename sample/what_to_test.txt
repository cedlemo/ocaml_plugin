Here is a small list of what to test with the run executable:
In any case, you might want to use -shell-verbose or -shell-echo
to have a better idea of what is happening.

UNEMBEDDED MODE
---------------

this mode uses a shared OCaml compiler found in the path,
and need -I option to find its needed cmi files

./run.exe
  default command, it loads 3 config files without errors

./run.exe -error
  try to load config_v1_error.ml which is not well typed
  fail with a proper type error message

./run.exe -n -v1 config/config_01.ml
  try to load without adding the -I flags to the cmi
  this fail with an Unbound module

./run.exe -n -I . -I ../lib -v1 config/config_01.ml
  work well

./run.exe -n -I . -I ../lib -v2 config/config_02.ml
  should not work because config_v2 uses some utility functions
  defined in config/config_util.ml
  fail with undefined symbols

./run.exe -n -I . -I ../lib -f config/config_util.ml -v2 config/config_02.ml
  work well

You can use -tmp as well as -clean if you are not interested in seeing
the copied files and the compilation directory.

STANDALONE MODE
---------------

This mode is more tricky, it uses an ocamlopt embedded in the executable
as well as cmi files so that the resulting executable do not need
any of them.

For that purpose, you need to enrich the executable run.exe using
the tool provided in the bin/ directory:

../bin/ocaml_embed_compiler.exe -exe run.exe -cc $(which ocamlopt) dsl.cmi ../lib/ocaml_plugin.cmi -o run-standalone.exe

Then, you can try:

./run-standalone.exe -embed
  work well

./run.exe -embed
  fail during the extraction of embedded section since the executable is not
  standalone

You can try also to forget an cmi file and see what happen

../bin/ocaml_embed_compiler.exe -exe run.exe -cc $(which ocamlopt) ../lib/ocaml_plugin.cmi -o run-standalone.exe
./run-standalone.exe -embed
  fail with an unbound module (dsl.cmi is missing)

BUILD RULES
-----------

Now, we have a dedicated build rule to build standalone executable.
Cf OMakefile: OCamlMakeStandaloneExecutables

-------------
You can also try with some more config files.
